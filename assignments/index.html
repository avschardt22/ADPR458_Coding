            <h2>Avryn Schardt</h2>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying advertising and public relations. I am from Ankeny, Iowa, so I am an out-of-state student. As a part of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications, I have been able to further my knowledge and develop my passions for writing and creativity.</p>
        
            <h3>Classes This Semester</h3>
            <p>This semester, along with Interactive Media Design, I am on the Bateman PR competition team. Our team is working to create a campaign for a nonprofit, EveryLibrary, which is a national organization dedicated to supporting libraries at a national level. I am also in a couple classes that count toward my minor like Activism in Feminist Communities, where I am also completing volunteer hours at the Gender and Sexuality Center on campus.</p>

            <h3>Outside of Class</h3>
            <p>I am a member of the UNL Drumline in the Cornhusker Marching Band where I play snare drum. I also hold the media coordinator position on the executive team in the UNL Percussion Club. These activities have given me opportunities to continue my love of music while surrounding me with a community of friends. I also joined the admissions team as a campus host, and I enjoy connecting with potential new students and sharing my love of the university with them.</p>
        
            <h3>After Graduation</h3>
            <p>I am still not 100% sure what I want to do after I graduate in December, but I feel like I am learning a lot about what I like and what I am good at. I really enjoy creative execution and organization of campaigns. I also enjoy connecting with people, so I would also love to incorporate that into my future career.</p>
